Hey everyone. I'm a junior front end developer 
and I feel I'm getting very close to being job ready.

While looking at job descriptions I've realized
 that one of the only things I'm missing is the ability
  to test my code. I need to learn some sort of testing
   framework such as Jest.

What would be the best way to get started with this?
 Should I dive straight into Jest or should I first
  take a fundamentals course on testing in Javascript? 
  Any help would be greatly appreciated!



*Just to clarify, my knowledge of testing is 0*


=====================================================================

Dive in to jest. Create some simple functions and test them:

function adder(n1, n2) {
  return n1 + n2;
}

describe('adder', () => {
  it('adds two numbers', () => {
    expect(adder(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  )
});
stuff like that (just noticed this is the 
basic example in their getting started page!). 
If you have some experience with a framework like React, 
consider creating a basic app and testing that (if using React,
 React Testing Library is popular).

Also, my experience is that juniors aren't really expect to
 know all that much about testing. You can learn it on the job.
