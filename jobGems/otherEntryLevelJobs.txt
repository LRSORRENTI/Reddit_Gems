Other entry level roles instead of frontend/web dev?
=====================================================

Question:

Like a lot of other people on this sub,
 I’ve been applying with no luck.
 
  200+ applications since October,
   1 interview, and countless rejections.
   
    I really want to get started right 
    away with a web dev job but doesn’t 
    seem I will have luck anytime soon. 
    
    Are there any other entry level IT roles
     I could get into to pave my way into web dev? 
     
     Are helpdesk/customer support/representative roles
      a good way to start so I can eventually land
       a web dev role along the way?

       Look for quality roles: QE, QA, SDE, SDET. 
       
       These are whole complex fields on their own, 
       that you can make a career in, 
       but companies also often use them as 
       an entry-level hire with the possibility 
       of moving to developer.
       
        It's not a bad model - if you can learn
         to properly test a code base then 
         you'll be prepared to develop in it for sure.

        As someone who does automation engineering / SDET, sure.
        
         But there are some huge differences
          in the type of work being done.
          
           And IMO QA work is very boring.
           
            Lots and lots of test cases to manage.

           But yeah, it’ll get your foot in the door.

            Hijacking! This is exactly what 
            I did at my company! Went from sales
             -> product support -> QA Engineer ->
              and now they said I can start pulling
               in dev tickets if I feel comfortable. 
               
               Most people I see in the online
                learning community want to go from like,
                 fast food worker -> software engineer.
                 
                  That’s possible, but really hard
                   if you can’t dedicate months/years
                    to just educating yourself. 
                    
                    If you want to work in the meantime 
                    while you learn, my path above would work great!

                    I don’t really agree with this sentiment.
                    
                     Truth is most of the CS majors I work
                      with know just about as much as a 3
                       month coding boot camp graduate.
                       
                        The real difference is just how big their ego is.
                        
                         Reality is the tech industry is desperate 
                         for people. 
                         
                         If you can deal with the stress
                          of never knowing the “right” 
                          answer to whatever problem that is
                           assigned to you and like to read books about 
                           abstract concepts then come join the party. 
                           
                           Just make sure you are honest about your 
                           abilities.

                          P.s. ask for lots of money

                          I re-post this every once in a while if I
                           think there's a possibility it might be relevant.
                           
                            Might not be here, but hopefully it
                             could be useful to someone reading it...

My success rate with getting jobs through ads, 
recruiters or job sites is 0%.

 I've applied to lots over the years, 
 and never got any of them, or was offered the
  job but then decided I didn't want to work
   there for whatever reason.

100% of my employment and
 contract work has come through either:

Word of mouth.

Randomly bulk emailing companies
 in my industries - regardless of 
 whether they were looking for people or not.

More often than not, the jobs I got never
 even got to the point of them putting a
  job ad up to begin with - because I 
  randomly popped up in their inbox at
   the right time, and was good enough
    for them not to bother wasting any more
     time filling their gap.
     
      Some of them weren't even at
       the point of creating a new position to fill yet,
        but they needed to get some project done, 
        and there I was, I just fell into their
         lap at the right time.

The shotgun approach is not only good for
 the bulk numbers (in a very short amount of time),
  but getting in early before the competition does. 
  
  It also shows a little bit of initiative.
   Most of these managers/clients have been 
   too busy to get to the job ad and interviewing process etc.
   
    You could be saving them work that
     they didn't want to do. Very few are going
      to be annoyed and consider this as actual "spam" -
       as long as you write your message in the format
        of a regular email you would send 
        applying for jobs... not some flashy/annoying marketing spiel.

By the time their job ad is posted, they've probably 
also already started talking to candidates that have
 come in through word of mouth. 
 
 People replying to the ads are 
 probably the last ones in the door to get interviewed.

How to do:

Spend a few days browsing the web for 
companies you might be relevant to, 
and collect their email addresses or 
contact form URLs if there is no email address shown.

 At least 50, maybe 100 or more if you can find them.
  Even if the company isn't totally relevant to you,
   they might pass you on to someone they know -
    this bit is important to consider.

Write up a generic email to them all basically saying
 "hello I'm looking for work they may be relevant to your company,
  here's my relevant skills to your industry". 
  
  Attach your resume.

   Make sure you send each email separately,
    i.e. one TO recipient for every contact.
     i.e. Don't put multiple recipients on the TO/CC/BCC lines.

For the web forms, just copy and paste your
 generic email in, maybe with a web link to your resume.

Important: ask for referrals

In the initial email you send 
(don't expect them to respond first),
 it's also worth asking them to pass your details
  on to anyone else / other companies they
   know who might need someone like you. 
   
   This has worked for me multiple times,
    and in most cases they never would have 
    thought to forward me on to someone else 
    unless I specifically mentioned it in that initial email.

In closing:

If you contact 100 companies (without even any pass-ons)
 and have a 1% success rate, then you might have
  a new job within a week... 
  
  especially if they're not actually
   formally advertising/interviewing etc 
   - very common in smaller companies.

You might even get a job you like that
 you didn't consider applying for. 
 
 The first job I ever got I used this
  process above looking for IT work, 
  but got a sweet video editing / audio recording 
  AV job at a university, purely from some stuff 
  I had listed in my "hobbies" section on my resume.

Formal job applications are 100% expectations-based
 from both sides. But opportunities often
  come when you least expect them.

Also there's the fact that when jobs are going
 through recruitment companies, they take a big
  fee from the employer (out of your
   on-going wage too sometimes)...
   
    employers would much rather not have
     to pay this fee, so candidates
      coming in directly have another advantage here.

In my experience, 
companies tend to hire
 less during the last 
 quarter of the year.

200 applications isn’t
 really that much in 
 the grand scheme of things
  for a junior position. 
  
  I found my first job after
   sending out about 150
    applications but that
     was 6 years ago when
      the demand for juniors
       was much higher than 
       it is now.
       
        My old roommate last year 
        sent out nearly 500 applications 
        over 8 months before finding his 
        first software engineering role. 
        
        He wasn’t the strongest interviewer
         so that made it difficult, but 
         times are hard for people trying
          to break into the field.

Don’t settle for a shittier position
 unless you absolutely need a job 
 right now. 
 
 My current roommate is a software
  development engineer in test (SDET)
   because that was the first
    engineering job he could get,
     and now he’s pigeonholed in
      positions that pay a lot less
       than normal front or backend 
       engineering. Same goes for other 
       IT jobs… there’s really not much 
       room for lateral movement 
       from those positions.
       
        If you absolutely must work
         right now than it’s definitely
          better than a non-technical role, 
          but I would suggest you keep working
           on your interviewing skills and keep
            applying to junior software developer positions.

            I started as a manual QA tester,
             moved into developing automated tests,
              then moved into Front-end.

Definitely look at QA, I'd say.
