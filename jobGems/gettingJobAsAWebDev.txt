QUESTION
==========

I think I may have to give 
up on this whole thing because 
I feel like I'm wasting my time and money.

 I've spent hundreds of dollars in a 
 coding bootcamp that taught me a lot. 
 
 HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and all of
  its advanced features, and even a
   short design course.
   
    On top of this I already knew the
     basics of Javascript and HTML & CSS
      since I was in high school.

I can build basic web apps.
 I have built 3 projects so far that 
 I'm proud of. They don't look fancy,
  but they do have a UI and they work.
  
   So far I've built a recipe search engine,
    a movie recommendation app that uses
     the OpenAI API and the OMDb API,
      and a todo app. 
      
      These apps are all built in react 
      and one uses Tailwind CSS.

When I go to sites like Indeed or 
Glassdoor, everyone is looking for 
Senior Web Developers with like 4+
 years of experience in a professional setting. 
 
 How am I supposed to enter this field if no one 
 is looking for a new developer? 
 
 Do I have to lie and say I have experience? 
 
 Is this how everyone makes it in? 
 
 Is this field really that over saturated?

I have no degree. I did two years 
of computer science and it just wasn't for me.
 Didn't learn anything useful, and the cost was
  ridiculous, so I thought that web development 
  would be my thing.
  
   I enjoy it a lot, and I always hear how 
   employers don't care if you have a degree
    or not as long as you can show them you
     know how to solve problems.

Maybe I'm just not that good,
 but I'm beginning to think that that was a lie.

If I have no professional experience
 and no degree, how do I make it? 
 
 I'd be happy with a minimum wage job to start.
 
  Just anything that can say "hey, you are
   working as a web developer now."

If you guys have any tips or if I'm
 missing something crucial please let me know.
 
  My passion really is building apps, 
  but if I cannot land any sort of job
   I'd have no other choice but to start
    working in the factory where
     a lot of family works in.
     
      I'm not looking forward to sorting
       boxes and blender parts...

       You have to apply for tons of positions.
       
        Search linkedin, google, dice.
        
         I also have no degree, I got started 
         at a smaller company.

Practice interviewing and make 
sure your resume is done well;
 1 page, lists technologies you're familiar
  with bulletpoints right up top.
  
   All your contact info, phone #,
    email, address, github, linkedin.

If you don't have one create a linkedin 
profile and fill it out, treat it like
 a professional facebook, recruiters 
 might reach out.
 
  Even if they don't it's a link you 
  can put on your resume.

You have React experience, 
I'd look for React developer 
positions and Javascript developer 
positions; and apply to at least 5 a day.

 Getting this first job is going to be 
 the hardest but you absolutely can do it.

Have a folder with: A master resume, 
list of 3 references, 
cover letter template. 

Each position you're going for read the posting,
 copy your master resume and edit 
 to include any info from the posting
  into your skills/abilities, 
  claiming any knowledge you possibly can
   (be honest but also generous to yourself). 
   
   Edit your master cover letter so that 
   it's an introduction about you and why
    you'd be good at this job.
    
     Include as much of the job
      posting as you can, if it 
      mentions Vue write that you are 
      interested in Vue and 
      have experience in React. 
      
      Talk about why you want to 
      work in this field; what about this
       position excited you?

Apply to positions where
 you meet 60%+ of the required skills.
 
  Don't apply for senior dev positions
   obviously, but also don't only apply
    if it says "Junior". 
    
    It might have been written by 
    someone who doesn't know what 
    that department wants and isn'
     familiar with the real requirements. 
     
     Also what's the worst thing that'll happen?
      You didn't get an interview? 

      If you don't apply you definitely
       won't get an interview,
        and you sent out 4 others just today.
        
         Take a shot.

If you get the interview
 that's great!
 
  Wear a tie, 
 clean background if it's video chat,
  and send a thank you note to whoever 
  interviewed you a few days after the interview. 
  
  Just a quick "Thanks for taking some time to 
  speak with me, I'm very interested in the
   position and please email me if I can
    provide any additional detail that 
    will help you make a decision."

Good luck!

RE to above comment
===================

One hundred on all of this, 
with the exception of 'Junior'
 in the posting title.
 
  I applied to about 150 positions
   total (including 'bulk' quick-apply 
   requisitions) over about 
   three months focusing on junior/entry level, 
   and landed my first job with a medium 
   sized tech company as a junior 
   from my well-curated LinkedIn profile. 
   
   This was important to me- I need a mentor,
    and the understanding that learning is the goal.

It also told me thar the team hiring me 
shared my ethics around this very problem. 

If you have more than a few hundred devs 
and you dont hire juniors, you're greedy.

It is such a frustrating situation. 
I hope that hard working curious 
people dont give up while waiting 
for the inevitable bubble pop that 
will happen when firms start
 needing many more affordable developers.

LinkedIn, and build up a network
 of recruiters. Some companies 
 only use recruiters.
 
  They don't even have the
   jobs on Indeed (and in my
    experience Indeed just has
     spammy ads and IT jobs anyway. 
     IT as in support, not development.) 
     
     For me, the developer network is on LinkedIn.

Also go to any related events in
 your area. 
 
 Mine has all kinds of Python meetups,
  JS meetups, UX meetups, Ruby, 
  Web Developers, Full Stack Developers, 
  the Front-End developers... all the names, 
  all similar people, you start to recognise 
  them and shake hands and before you know it,
   someone knows of an opening.

It's a lot harder in the US these days, 
tis true. But definitely not impossible.
