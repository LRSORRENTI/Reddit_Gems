Wow NEVER buy a .us domain 
without reading this first.

===========================================

I have registered a ton of domains 
through namecheap. Never had any issues. 

Maybe a week ago I registered a .us domain.
 Apparently WHOIS domain anonymizing
  doesn’t work for .us domain extensions. 
  
  I have received hundreds
  and hundreds of calls 
  to my personal cell, 
as well as texts in the last two days. 

No matter how good the domain is, 
nothing is worth this interruption. 

Going to try to get an IP phone number
 in the meantime, if it isn’t too expensive, 
 but I have a feeling my current number 
 is now out in the ether forever,
  and even updating Whois probably won’t help.

Just a word of warning do not 
even add personal contact info
 unless you want to be interrupted 10 
 times an hour.
 
  Calls forwarded through US 
  numbers all over the US, 
  yet every caller is clearly from India. 
  
  I understand people are trying 
  to make a living but this is
   getting out of control.

It's not that anonymization doesn't work, 
it's that having correct contact info
 is a legal/government requirement.
 
  The use of this ccTLD 
  (county code top level domain) 
  requires citizenship or a presence
   in the US for foreign companies,
    and that is essentially the reason 
    for this (verification, in a sense).

Supposedly there's random 
verification done by registrars,
 so giving inaccurate info may 
 lead to consequences if it's randomly checked.

 I would never recommend you do this, 
 but… you know you can just make that stuff up,
  right?

Put whatever you want in the WHOIS… 
nobody will care. 

Just make sure the email address
 is accessible because if you want to
  transfer the domain,
   they will often email a transfer code to it.

But the physical address 
and the phone number? 
If you were to just
 make it up and put
  anything you want there.

   it’s not like the domain name 
   police are going to come to 
   your house and arrest you.

                      .eu domains are the same
                       thing and although 
                       I'm not adventurous enough 
                       to make stuff up I put 
                       incomplete information 
                       in case someone bothers
                        me with it I can just
                         claim it was a typo.

                            Although I do know nobody
                             cares, I am a bit paranoid 
                             when it comes to this stuff.

                                            Huh? I have a .eu and it is 
                                            anonymized. If I put it in 
                                            whois all lines have a 
                                            "REDACTED_FOR_PRIVACY" 
                                            mention

As an aside:

I used to have a .cat domain 
for my portfolio. 

And, .cat requires your website
 be available in the Catalan language. 
 
 So I internationalized my whole website 
 and offered it to be viewed in Catalan.
 
  I have since discontinued the .cat domain 
  and no longer offer my website in Catalan. 
  
  But it was an interesting fold in plans and
   fun work.
