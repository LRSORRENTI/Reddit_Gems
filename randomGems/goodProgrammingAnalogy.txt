GOOD PROGRAMMING COMMENT

=================================
The following analogy is what I 
came up with to teach my juniors:
=====================================

Consider you have one lego block. 

There's not much you can so with it.

Now imagine you have 100 lego blocks,
 you can stack them up and probably
  end up with a small tower of lego 
  blocks or you can lay them in a 
  fashion and end up with a wall.

Now if you have a million
 lego blocks you could potentially make
  a castle but that would require a lot
   of planning, a lot of trial and error 
   since you are doing it for thr First Time.

However, if you do this often,
 you learn subtle tricks using
  which you can make a castle
   quickly and show off your skills.

Same logic applies to coding.
 Each lego block is CRUD

With one crud, just like one
 lego block you can't do
  much But if there are many
   crud, just like many lego 
   blocks you can make a full
    fledged software but for
     that you will need practice.

The way to learn coding 
would be to try and analyse 
anything and everything you
 use and figure out how crud
  would be working in background 
  for the item under investigation.

Hope this helps
