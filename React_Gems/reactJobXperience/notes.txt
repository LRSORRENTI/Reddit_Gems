Question
============

===================================================================
Feeling overwhelmed in my second React role. Advice appreciated
===================================================================

Iâ€™m a self taught dev and I landed my first React contract 
about a year ago. I still consider myself a junior. 
I started looking in October because my contract was 
coming to an end and found a job fairly quickly.

My new company started to develop a React version 
of their mobile app almost two years ago. It seems 
like they outsourced the project to a contractor 
firm based abroad and didnâ€™t have a senior react 
dev to manage the contractors. About 5 months ago,
 after firing the second batch of underperforming 
 devs from the contractor, my company realised the 
 work done is sub par and also doesnâ€™t use much 
 Typescript either as specified. They are working 
 to bring in local dev(s?) onboard which is 
 why they hired me.

I knew the lack of implementation of typescript 
and the need to rewrite a lot of the code from my interview. 
But Iâ€™ve found that the contractor (with 4-5 devs ) is
 still working on the codebase for at least another five months, 
 and also they are still not required to do pull requests.
  Some of their work could do with a code review. 
  It may be my dunning Kruger speaking but I
   believe they are mostly junior React devs skill wise.

The situation is Iâ€™m still onboarding, 
and I canâ€™t plan/review the work of 4 devs even 
if I werenâ€™t. We have one senior dev on the project since Oct,
 but he is a full stack, typescript specialist, rather
  than react specialist. Half of his time is on the backend work.
   Iâ€™m under pressure to develop features based on the most
    horrible spaghetti, anti typescript/ anti pattern code 
    Iâ€™ve never been able to imagine.

Iâ€™ve raised my concerns regarding code quality
 and the senior dev emailed management about needing
  PRs before merging features into release branch, 
  but I saw no changes in processes. CTO and project manager
   knows the code is bad.

Iâ€™ve succeeded to get them to use MUI as a UI library 
instead of coding their own , so late in the development cycle, 
installed Eslint etc, but Iâ€™m annoyed each time I see bad code. 
I see the contractors, unmanaged, continue to add to the chaos.
 Deadlines drive their work. I canâ€™t blame them
  entirely because I see they lack support.

I want to take ownership but I canâ€™t, and even I struggle
 with getting support from a senior.

What can I do. I feel burnt out after one month! Fml.
 Should I quit ?

Edit: All devs experience stress. Am I being melodramatic?
 Is this process/feelings to be expected when coming
  into a new codebase?

You can prevent pushes to the main brach and require PRs
 in the repo configuration: https://stackoverflow.com/a/57685576

I would start a new repo and slowly work to rewrite
 & migrate the contractor code over. That way the new 
 repo becomes the gold standard, and nothing that isn't
  PR'd/reviewed gets in. This approach also
 makes it look like you wrote the entire codebase ðŸ˜›

Obviously your company struggles with leadership,
 and since you're already considering quitting this seems 
 like a risk-free opportunity to develop your own managerial skills.
  If your higher-ups don't like your methods, then they'll
   get rid of you and you're free to move on. If they like
    your approach then you'll have proven yourself a creative 
    and effective leader and set yourself up for promotion. Win-win.

As for burn out, it sounds like the chaos is the driving factor. 
Don't sweat what you can't control. Contribute what you can,
 where you can, but the whole thing was a shit show before
  you got there so don't feel bad that you haven't fixed it 
  all in your first month!!

  Thank you for your advice. I fear I canâ€™t
   unilaterally request PRs because we lack 
   the resources to review them. And we got xyz 
   deliverables we need to hit etc. 
   
   But the contractors
    canâ€™t improve without PRs. And I canâ€™t improve without
     senior react devs either. 
     
     I appreciate your words about needing control. Iâ€™m doing some 
     work over Xmas break because I feel like Iâ€™m behind, but I 
     didnâ€™t expect how much anxiety I suffered 
     from working during the holidays. 
  (I donâ€™t resent learning dev outside of office hours).

  They hired you as what, junior/mid? Heads down work on your tasks 
  and ignore everyone else, point/score your tasks high, 
  write as much code from scratch as you can, use this repo a
   a sandbox to try new stuff and learn a lot, quit when you get
    something else.

Don't be afraid to disappoint them, the company focus is
 saving money on cheap labor and exploiting you to build a gazillion 
 features so they can make more money. You are not their saving grace 
 so stop holding yourself to that high standard.

And stop working during xmas break before you burn yourself out,
 you can continue "learning dev" (read: working) next year.

 The company hired me as a â€˜React developerâ€™ without
  specifying my level. But I guess the CTO dangled the
   prospect of me eventually taking over the React codebase one day.
    Which is why Iâ€™m so emotionally invested over the code quality.
  Thanks for sharing your views. I need boundaries.
