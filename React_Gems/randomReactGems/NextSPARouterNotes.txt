Does NextJS have a way of 
using the router in a purely
 SPA way? with transition?
=============================

===================================================
 I have one set of pages in my app where I don't
  want a page refresh. I want the pages to just
   slide from one to the other and back, but I
    want it to be routable such that the back 
    button slides back to the previous one.

Is this possible with Next's router?
====================================================

============
First Answer
============
I'm pretty sure that making it
 *feel* like that is what <Link> is for.

 Second Answer
 =============
 You would need to implement route transitions. 
 There‚Äôs a few different resources that show how 
 to do this but it would be mostly done in the _app.js file

 =============
 Third Answer
 =============

 <Link> tag or router.push(‚Äúyour-route‚Äù)

      ====================

      ====================
              
               when I do that, the page does a refresh

                      No, it doesn‚Äôt. Next is an SPA with client
                       side transitions only. You can ‚Äúopt out‚Äù by using anchor 
                      elements instead of Link components to navigate

                         MUI exposes a "Link" component.
                          They're not the same thing. 
                          That's very likely what's going on.

                              Here is a stackoverflow on that very topic:
                              https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66226576/using-the-material-ui-link-component-with-the-next-js-link-component

                                    There are two good solutions in there.
                                     First is using the OLD NextJs Link behavior.
                                      Second is using the MUI "component" prop.

                                        yep that was it. I was using a MUI Button..
                                         just switched to Link and it's working.
                                          is there an easy way to add animation 
                                          to the transition?

                         Build a template for the component/page.

                          Use an id or aria as your selector. 
                          Add some logic based around visibility/invisibility.

                            const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState("id")

                                Add a useEffect if needed and boom ü§Ø.

                                   If your stuck on the idea of ReactRouter 
                                   just install react router and stage the 
                                   components how you would in a traditional react spa.
                                    Don't forget, Next has React built in. 
                                    Everything still works the same.

                                        We build our messengers as SPA components essentially.
                                         Within our "Components" we essentially
                                          have a micro app with it's our index.tsx, 
                                          styles and sub components leveraging react router
