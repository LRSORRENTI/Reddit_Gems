==================================================
What should I 
do before learning State Managment System like Redux?
====================================================

theScottyJam:

Redux gained a lot of popularity when React 
didn't have great built-in state management solutions, 
and there really wasn't other good third-party solutions around.
 This isn't the case anymore, and there are plenty of other great
  state management solutions out there to use, some of which might
   be more user-friendly than vanilla redux.



Honestly, I wouldn't bother learning it 
just to learn it. Wait until you feel like your 
state is turning into a mess, then research different
 solutions that are out there to help solve your problem, 
 and pick the one that would be the best fit. The answer
  these days might not always be Redux. 
  
  It's hard to really
   appreciate what Redux, or other state-management tools
    can really do for you, until you have an actual problem
     for them to solve. Otherwise, 
they're just adding boilerplate with little benefit.
