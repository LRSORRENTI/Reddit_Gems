QUESTION
==========

What is the most efficient way to use 
CSS/SCSS in your project?

I always have to scroll through 
the css file to the class I want
 to update or create. 
 
 Is there an extension or a
  tool that would help me
   be more organized in 
   terms of style? 
   
   For example by clicking on the
    className in the project
     it pops up the stylesheet
      on the side for me to update easily?

      ANSWERS 
      =============================

     One SCSS file per component. 
     
     And use CSS Modules so you can import
      the classes into your JS file. 
      
      That way you don't need to worry 
      about name conflicts between components. 
      
      You can truly treat the styles as 
      isolated for each component. 

      ==================================

      Use CSS Modules

Example: stylename.module.css

NB: It creates a class with 
the given className with a
 random string attached to it.
 
  This makes it possible to use 
  the same classNames in different 
  components/pages/files

=========================================

SCSS modules get my preference.

I use the SCSS part to rest 
elements that belong to my component. 

The fewer elements, the better.

 I'd rarely nest anything deeper
  than three layers.

Keep it simple, and let
 CSS shine where it's best:
  in the browser.
  
   Use media queries and use CSS variables.

For example by clicking 
on the className in the
 project it pops up the stylesheet
  on the side for me to update easily?

Cmd + B in WebStorm 
(when focussed on
 className={styles.MyComponent} (the MyComponent part) brings me to the correct SCSS module immediately, and the correct line.
