Naw you should charge about 2500. Don’t sell yourself short.
 If they had a CMS you could charge 3500. It there are really
  high quality animations and design AND a CMS I’ve easily 
  charged 7000 in the past. Highest I’ve charged for a marketing 
  site for a bakery chain was 9800.

Charging too little makes them think you’re not professional 
or there’s something wrong with the product.

Also when you charge them, give them an invoice with a breakdown.

Something like:

Wire framing and Design: $800

Mobile responsive: $200

Development: $1500

Should do the trick

If it takes you a couple of hours, then it’s probably not the 
best quality. My last 5 or so page site took about a week when
 doing work around color palettes, design decisions, SEO decisions,
  content review and adjustment, coding the site to make sure 
  everything is responsive and animations work properly with no
   performance hit on lower quality devices.

I would be uncomfortable giving a client a website after a
 couple of hours.

Take the wonder bread marketing site for example even though
 their mobile site has some small issues here and there. 
 If you ignore the extra pages for the individual recipes and products,
  that’s what I’d consider to be a basic website that should cost
   2500 if not way more. And that’s about 5 pages or so. I wouldn’t
    feel comfortable giving a client anything less than that.

    Answer 2.
    ==================

    never do business without a contract. ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILY.

Figure out your hourly rate. There are many tools out 
there to help you calculate this. Since you're 
freelance/self-employed in this case, you're going 
to be paying taxes on this yourself and not your regular employer.

INVOICE - You need to provide an invoice. Now hear me out.
 Your family is going to likely ask you to be cheaper
  than you think, which means you're now in between a 
  rock and a hard place.
  
   So here's where the invoice comes in.
  
   You make the invoice with the fully detailed breakdown of costs. 
   Your NORMAL hourly rat
   e x the number of hours + any additional 
   costs for plugins etc. 
   
   then on another timeline you can list 
   out any discounts. 
   
   The purpose of doing this is so that your
    friends and family KNOW how much you normally charge,
     and what your willing to provide for a discount. 

     This in some effect anchors them and prevents them from
      low balling you even further. It also allows them to 
      see your actual cost when they tell their
       friends about your work.

respect your work and respect your cost of doing business.

I’d charge $3k, especially if it has good styling and good design,
 and is indexed to google search I might add.

How much time have you spent on it?

Always charge for your time and expertise.

Eg- if I’m doing a 5 page website and 
estimate it will take 40-50 hrs, I charge $75/hr. 

I will take a middle number of 45. So that’d be
 $3375 for the project. 
 
 I’d probably just charge 3000 or 3500, 
 depending how the first meeting or two went (easy going client?, 
 recommended from friend/associate?, do they want extra animations 
 or effects?, we’re they nice or rude?, etc)

If it were a family member, I’d probably knock off another 500-1000.

DO NOT listen to advice of people that say “don’t charge hourly”.
 Estimate your time on the project and multiple that by an hourly rate.
  (20-50 for a jr, 50-100 for an experienced designer/dev, 
  maybe 100+ for expertise/specialists, 
  agencies often charge 100-200/hr).

Also, make a projected project contract 
with expected deliverables, project timeline,
 and potential overages). Google web project
