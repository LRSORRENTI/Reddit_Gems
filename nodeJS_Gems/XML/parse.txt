 How to parse and create XML with Node.js

 =================================================

Writing and parsing XML files with Node.js
 might not be one of the first things that 
 strike your mind. On the contrary, the Fast
  XML parser has millions of downloads per 
  week on NPM. In this post, you will learn
   how to validate and parse XML with Node.js.
    You will also learn to generate an XML file from 
JavaScript objects. Let's get started!

====================================================

Is XML still used ???

===================

You might be wondering in this era of
 JSON and REST is XML still used. In addition, 
 with newer options to communicate between services 
 like GraphQL and gRPC the use of XML should have
  declined significantly in recent years. To your 
  surprise, having worked for million-dollar 
  companies I can verify that even business-critical 
  processes depend on XML and parsing of it. For 
  example, Microsoft Navision ERP 
  (now called Business Central) still
   supports Simple Object Access Protocol
    (SOAP) web services that communicate using XML.

Letâ€™s assume for an e-commerce website, 
the customer order is taken from the checkout
 system built with Node.js and MySQL database.
  The warehouse, however, is managed with a 
  Microsoft Business Central ERP (moved from Navision). It is very likely that the orders are sent to the ERP from the web system using SOAP and XML. The cost of rewriting the business critical part is high in terms of writing a new service as well as managing the risk of failure.

In comparison fast-XML-parser NPM package
 has more downloads/week (6 million) than 
 Vue (3.4 million) or Angular (3 million).

Thereby XML is used and will be 
used in the future too

=============================================

To follow along with the example code
 below for this tutorial, below are 
 some of the requisites:

- Prior knowledge of JavaScript, NPM, 
and the Node.js ecosystem will be beneficial. 
The example will be run with Node.js 18 
the current LTS version.

- Understanding the difference between 
common js and es6 modules will be helpful

- Using git and GitHub will be necessary

- Any previous experience working with 
XML will be advantageous
Given that is mentioned, you can proceed to
 get your hands dirty with code now
